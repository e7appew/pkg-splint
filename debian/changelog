splint (1:3.1.2+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * QA upload.
  * Fix VCS URLs in debian/control file.
  * Increment Debhelper compatibility level to 10.
  * Suppress Lintian warning: debian-watch-may-check-gpg-signature.
  * Remove obsolete file: debian/README.source.
  * Build with all hardening flags set.
  * debian/control: Fix splint-data's relationship to previous versions.
  * Convert patch headers to DEP-3 format compatible with gbp.
  * Update autoconf patches to work only on files not automatically generated.
  * Do not automatically un-apply patches so that clean is done properly.
  * Fix clean up rule in test/db3/Makefile.
  * Perform wrap and sort on all Debian control files.
  * Fix spelling mistakes in source and documentation.
  * Fix possible privacy breach issues in documentation.
  * Fix autoconf and automake warnings.
  * Force non-parallel builds, since parallel builds don't complete
    reliably.
  * Do not capture build path, host name or user name to make
    builds fully reproducible.
  * Convert debian/copyright file to DEP-5 format and update.
  * Update rules for creating DFSG upstream tarballs.
    This is so that we can correct the package's versioning, by
    replacing the appended .dfsg* with +dfsg* instead. The image file,
    doc/html/glowingwall-narrows.jpg, has also been included for the
    documentation package, and XZ compression is now used.
  * Remove superfluous duplication of tests.
  * Try to separate arch-specific and -independent rules.
  * Add doc-base registration for HTML documentation.
    In addition, standardise file extensions of all HTML files, and
    provide convenience links to them from the main package. (Closes: #548122)
  * Fix segmentation fault. (Closes: #775917)
  * Cherry-pick unreleased fix for parsing unary plus. (Closes: #462375)
  * Cherry-pick unreleased fix for "hh" printf modifier support.
    (Closes: #510821)
  * Cherry-pick unreleased upstream fix in order to handle C99-style
    mixing of statements and declarations. (Closes: #369264)
  * Update 03_359894_VA_ARGS.patch to the one applied upstream.
    The patch applied upstream also adds a check for +gnuextensions.
  * Cherry-pick other relevant unreleased upstream changes,
    so that we're fully up-to-date with "CVS" upstream.
  * Backup and restore mutable files for idempotent builds.
  * Add multiarch include path to standard include search paths.
    (Closes: #675025)
  * Fix names of timespec members. (Closes: #680121)
  * Fix Internal Bug at cscannerHelp.c:2428.
    (Closes: #473595, #476228, #498345, #548768, #569928, #601424)
  * debian/control: Fix splint-doc-html's relationship to prior versions
    of splint.
  * For build reproducibility, move *.lcd files to the main package
    as they contain architecture-specific information.
  * Move man page to main package to avoid Lintian warnings when
    building architecture-specific package alone.
  * Add LFS support to 32-bit architectures.
  * Indicate compliance with Debian Policy 4.1.0.
